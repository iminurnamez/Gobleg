#Egg Lob

This challenge focuses on creating an app based on the classic word game Boggle. 



#Challenge

Create an app for honing your Boggle skills. There are two different approaches you could take: clicking on letter tiles with
 the mouse or typing in letters with the keyboard. Going the clicking on tiles route should be much easier to implement. If you're
 looking for more of a challenge try using keyboard input. 
 
Note that the letter Q is actually Qu.
